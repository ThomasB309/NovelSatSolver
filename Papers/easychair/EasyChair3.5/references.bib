 abstract = {In this paper we study the problem of solving hard propositional satisfiability problem (SAT) instances in a computing grid or cloud, where run times and communication between parallel running computations are limited.We study analytically an approach where the instance is partitioned iteratively into a tree of subproblems and each node in the tree is solved in parallel.We present new methods for constructing partitions which combine clause learning and lookahead. The methods are incorporated into the iterative approach and its performance is demonstrated with an extensive comparison against the best sequential solvers in the SAT competition 2009 as well as against two efficient parallel solvers.},

@inproceedings{Martins.2012,
 abstract = {Multicore processors are becoming the dominant platform in modern days. As a result, parallel Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) solvers have been developed to exploit this new architecture. Sharing

learned clauses in parallel MaxSAT is expected to help to further prune the search space and boost the performance of a parallel solver. Yet, so far it has not been made clear which learned clauses should be shared

among the different threads. This paper studies the impact of clause sharing heuristics. Evaluating these heuristics can be a hard task in parallel MaxSAT because existing solvers suffer from non-determinism behavior,

i.e. several runs of the same solver can lead to different solutions. This is a clear downside for applications that require solving the same problem instance more than once, such as the evaluation of heuristics. For a fair evaluation, this paper presents the first deterministic parallel MaxSAT solver that ensures reproducibility of results. By using a deterministic solver one can independently evaluate the gains coming from the use of different heuristics rather than the non-determinism of the solver. Experimental results show that sharing learned clauses improves the overall

performance of parallel MaxSAT solvers. Moreover, the performance of the new deterministic solver is comparable to the corresponding nondeterministic version.},

@inproceedings{Bartok.2014,
 abstract = {Solvers for Boolean satisability (SAT), like other algorithms for NP-complete problems,

tend to have a heavy-tailed runtime distribution. Successful SAT solvers make use of frequent

restarts to mitigate this problem by abandoning unfruitful parts of the search space after some

time. Although frequent restarting works fairly well, it is a quite simplistic technique that

does not do anything explicitly to make the next try better than the previous one. In this

paper, we suggest a more sophisticated method: using a best-rst-search approach to quickly

move between di

erent parts of the search space. This way, the search can always focus on the

most promising region. We investigate empirically how the performance of frequent restarts,

best-rst-search, and a combination of the two compare to each other. Our ndings indicate

that the combined method works best, improving 36-43{\%} on the performance of frequent

restarts on the used set of benchmark problems.},

@inproceedings{Fu.2006,
 abstract = {Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) has seen many successful applications in various fields, such as Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, in some cases it may be required/preferable to use variations of the general SAT problem. In this paper we consider one important variation, the MinimumCost Satisfiability Problem (MinCostSAT). MinCostSAT is a SAT problem which minimizes the cost of the satisfying assignment. MinCostSAT has various applications, e.g. Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG), FPGA Routing, AI Planning, etc. This problem has been tackled before -- first by covering algorithms, e.g. scherzo [3], and more recently by SAT based algorithms, e.g. bsolo [16]. However the SAT algorithms they are based on are not the current generation of highly efficient solvers. The solvers in this generation, e.g. Chaff [20], MiniSat [5] etc., incorporate several new advances, e.g. two literal watching based Boolean Constraint Propagation, that have delivered order of magnitude speedups. We first point out the challenges in using this class of solvers for the MinCostSAT problem and then present techniques to overcome these challenges. The resulting solver MinCostChaff shows order of magnitude improvement over several current best known branchand-bound solvers for a large class of problems, ranging from Minimum Test Pattern Generation, Bounded Model Checking in EDA to Graph Coloring and Planning in AI.},
